Turtle Trouble 

Turtle Trouble is a 2D side-scrolling game developed in Unity as part of my learning portfolio.
Players control a turtle swimming through underwater environments, avoiding hazards and collecting items to score points.

I implemented core gameplay mechanics, player controls, collision detection, scoring system, and UI elements using C#. All visual elements and sprites were hand-drawn by me.
The game features smooth side-scrolling movement, diverse sprite animations, interactive obstacles, and collectible items.

🛠️ Technologies: Unity, C#, Git, GitHub
🎮 Platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux (built and tested on Windows; can be built for Mac and Linux)
